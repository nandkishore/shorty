  body: Flush the cache from all memcache servers. A non-zero value for <tt>delay</tt> will ensure that the flush is propogated slowly through your memcached server farm. The Nth server will be flushed N*delay seconds from now, asynchronously so this method returns quickly. This prevents a huge database spike due to a total flush all at once.
